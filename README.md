### Tomato_disease_prediction_Project
Project to detect the disease of Tomato using CNN


## Project Overview
This project focuses on utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect diseases in tomato plants based on images. The implementation involves several machine learning steps, including importing libraries, loading datasets, visualizing data, data preprocessing, and building and evaluating the CNN model.


## Data set used:
The data was taken from the 'Plant Villagr dataset' from Kaggle.


## Background
The common observed diseases of Tomato Plant are:
**Bacterial Spot**: A bacterial disease causing characteristic spots on leaves, often surrounded by a yellow halo.
**Early Blight**: A fungal disease characterized by the appearance of concentric rings and dark lesions on leaves, starting from the lower foliage.
**Late Blight:** Another fungal disease causing dark lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, often leading to significant yield loss.
**Leaf Mold:** A disease characterized by the development of yellow or brown patches on the leaves, often accompanied by a fuzzy, mold-like growth.
**Mosaic Virus:** A viral infection causing mosaic-like patterns on leaves, typically resulting in distorted growth.
**Septoria Leaf Spot:** A fungal disease leading to the formation of small, circular spots with a dark center on the leaves.
**Spider Mites:** Infestation by tiny arachnids that can cause yellowing and stippling of leaves due to feeding.
**Target Spot:** A fungal disease causing dark concentric rings on leaves, resembling a target pattern.
**Yellow Leaf Curl Virus:** A viral infection causing curling, yellowing, and distortion of leaves, ultimately affecting plant growth.

These categories are crucial for training a machine learning model to recognize and classify different diseases accurately. The model learns to differentiate between healthy plants and those affected by specific diseases based on visual patterns present in the images associated with each category.
